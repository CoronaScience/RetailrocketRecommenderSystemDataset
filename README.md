# Retailrocket Recommender System

The objective of this project is to create a Recommender System based on the data offered by kaggle 
"https://www.kaggle.com/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset".

# Dataset

The dataset consists of three files: a file with behaviour data (events.csv), a file with item properties 
(itemproperties.сsv) and a file, which describes category tree (categorytree.сsv). The data has been collected from 
a real-world ecommerce website. It is raw data, i.e. without any content transformations, however, all values are hashed 
due to confidential issues. The purpose of publishing is to motivate researches in the field of recommender systems with 
implicit feedback.
